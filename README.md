# Hopfield Network Implementation

![Hopfield Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hopfield-net-vector.svg)
Welcome to the **Hopfield Network Implementation** repository! This project implements a Hopfield Network from scratch using Python and NumPy. Hopfield Networks are a form of recurrent artificial neural network used to store and retrieve patterns efficiently. They serve as associative memory systems and can recall stored patterns even with partial or noisy input.

## üåü Features

- **Simple Implementation**: Easy-to-understand code that implements a Hopfield Network from scratch.
- **Pattern Storage and Recall**: Stores multiple patterns and recalls them accurately.
- **Energy Function**: Evaluates the energy of the network to find stable states.
- **Visualizations**: Demonstrates pattern retrieval through visual examples.

## üìö Background

### What is a Hopfield Network?

A Hopfield Network is a type of recurrent neural network invented by John Hopfield in 1982. It consists of binary threshold nodes and is primarily used as an associative memory model. The network can retrieve stored patterns even if the input is noisy or incomplete. The concept relies on the energy minimization principle, where the network's dynamics guide it toward stable states (local minima) that correspond to stored patterns.

### Key Characteristics

- **Symmetric Weights**: Connections between neurons have symmetric weights, i.e., \( w_{ij} = w_{ji} \).
- **Binary States**: Neurons have binary states, either +1 or -1.
- **Deterministic Dynamics**: The network updates one neuron at a time until it converges to a stable pattern.
